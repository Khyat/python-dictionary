# python-dictionary
Simple dictionary built using Python.

# Getting Started
Basically we don't require any fancy packages to run this dictionary, for now!

# Basic modules we're going to work with
## difflib module
With the help of this module we can compute and work with differences between sequences. It is useful for comparing texts.

## difflib.get_close_matches()
get_close_matches returns a list of best "Good enough" matches.

## JSON module
First of all in order to work with this app we need data.So, We are using a JSON file which includes different words to fetch different definitions. Python's JSON library will help us parse objects from JSON files. It will parse JSON file into dictionary or list datatypes.

In order to run this app we need to use terminal or command line, Run `python3 word.py`.

Prompt will appear for you to enter any word to find it's definition.

For now this app only runs in terminal environment, but I'm scaling it to a web app so, I'll update this repo as soon as it's ready! Until then, Cheers!
